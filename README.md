# GEO5017-Linear-Regression

## Project description

This project was developed as a solution for the assignment 1 in the Machine Learning course GEO5017 lectured at TU Delft.
The main aim of this program is to solve linear regression exercises proposed in the assignment.

## Dependencies

The code uses the Numpy library (https://numpy.org/) and Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)

## How to use this code

This program plot the trajectory and computes both the weight model and residual error for a set of known coordinates in the 3D space. The program works by taking a known set of coordinates stored as a numpy array.

For doing so, functions for gradient, gradient descendent and residual error computation were developed.

The output of the program is a ploted trajectory (Question 1) and print statements of the model weights and residual error for both constant speed and constant acceleration (Question 2).
